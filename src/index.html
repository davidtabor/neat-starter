				Overwhelmed, overstimulated, drowning in choices. You want what's best for your family - both kids and parents - but you catch yourself wondering if you're making the right decisions. Modern parenting is full of “change-your-life” products, services, and #goals, but are they really that good? Are the tried and true really just good marketing? Is that trendy machine or subscription just a fad, or could it measurably improve your
				life?
			</li>
			<li class="mt-6">You've got questions. We've got well-researched answers! The best part is, our research is informed by your personality and parenting style! We want the best answer for our clients’ situation - not just the answer that fits the average parent. From peer-reviewed journals to crunchy facebook groups we’ll search it all to provide you with the most relevant information, distilled into useful action points.</li>
